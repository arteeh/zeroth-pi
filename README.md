# zeroth-pi
I decided to replace the Milk-V Duo on the Zeroth-01 with a Raspberry Pi. I did this because I want to replace the eyes with a RealSense D421 stereo camera, which needs to connect to the main board using USB-C which the Milk-V does not have spare.

I also prefer the more familiar Debian OS and the huge Pi community as the foundation for my robot project.

I decided to go for the pricier servo driver HAT, because it can use the battery to properly power the Pi without any wiring.
